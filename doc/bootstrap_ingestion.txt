If ingesting multiple SSTable files, the ranges can not overlap.
However, backfill via SSTable files:
1. is much(?) faster than inserting individual entries
2. allows write behind and latest updates wins

To work around this:
1. When increasing cluster size, since the db is new, the bootstrap sources can be merge sorted into one SSTable file.
2. When decreasing cluster size, the source data should also be merge sorted for better performance.
   During ingestion, each row should be inserted one by one, and checking existing entry's updatedAtNs.


To simplify this even further:
1. Do not use the SSTable ingestions.
2. Only ensure ordered-insert.
3. During insert, use MergeOperator to speed up dup checking
