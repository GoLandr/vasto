Topology Change
===============

A cluster is a set of servers in a data center and serves data from one keyspace.
One server can have multiple keyspaces. Here we only covers topology change in one cluster.

This design covers replacing a server in a keyspace, adding servers to a cluster, removing servers from a cluster.

Replace a server in a keyspace
--------------------------------
Assuming there are a list of nodes with replicated shards.
There are existing shard A and B. Shard C is a new shard that's going to replace A.
B is just one of the peer shards of A.

Notation:
<=> means follow each other
=> means unidirectional follow.
-> means clients read/write to the shard.

0. at beginning,
    -> A, A <=> B
1. master tell a server to create shard C, and unidirectionally follow A.
1.1 the server creates shard C, and follows A, and follow other peer shards
    -> A, A <=> B, A => C, B => C
1.2 the new shard is marked is_candidate, for normal clients, read/write both switch from A to C.
    (possibly some slow clients) -> A, -> C, A <=> B, A => C, B => C
2. master wait until all "replicate shard prepare" requests are completed, and tell shard Cs to promote themselves, (but not sending shard status to master)
3. master set these shards status to READY, and remove old shard, and add the new shard. Broadcast this to all clients for this keyspace
3.1 all clients remove the old server, and move the candidate server to the right position.
4. master wait a period of time for the slow clients, tell shard A to cleanup
4.1 shard A wait until no traffic, shuts down
4.2 shard C found A is gone, and not going to follow shard A any more.
4.3 for store clients, shard B as a client detected this change, and starts to follow C from beginning
    -> C, B <=> C


Remove servers from a cluster
--------------------------------





Notes
-----
1. follow progress is stored with key as (server_address, shard_id), so
    any new following always starts from beginning.
    new shard needs to warm up and following from source shard for a while.
